    <summary>Introduction to symmetry</summary>

<p>
Before talking about symmetry, let's start with the more familiar
situation of quantifying amount. A typical question we might pose to a
very young child is "which pile has more marbles?"</p>

<center>
<%= image_tag("marbles-4-7.jpg", width: "30%") %>
</center>

<p>
Versions of this question can be answered by even animals such as
birds. No specialized language is required to make qualitative
comparisons on the level or "more" or "less." But we have developed
the language of the positive integers to enable ourselves to answer
such questions more precisely. Rather than simply saying the righthand
pile has more marbles, we can say it has <i>three more</i> marbles
because the lefthand pile has four marbles and the righthand pile has
seven marbles.</p>

<p>
Returning to symmetry, we can ask an analogous question in regards to
the below three images: "Which image has the most symmetry?"</p>

<center>
<%= image_tag("p3m1-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
<%= image_tag("p31m-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
<%= image_tag("p1-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
</center>

<!-- <image src="p3m1-blue.jpg" alt="Tiling with p3m1 symmetry" width="300px"> -->
<!-- <image src="p31m-blue.jpg" alt="Tiling with p31m symmetry" width="300px"> -->

<p>
It's less obvious what to say here. Some people might propose the
righthand picture has "less" symmetry (whatever that means), but few
are likely to be able to immediately say much more than that. While we
are taught numbers in school to help us quantify amounts, a
specialized language for symmetry is not part of a standard US
education. One goal of this help page is to give you a short
introduction to this language. (For details on how to <b>use</b>
SymmetryCat, see <%= link_to "this page", help_path %>.) To this end,
let's return for a moment to counting.</p>

<center>
<%= image_tag("three-piles.jpg", width: "50%") %>
</center>

<p>
Using numbers, we learn at an early age to recognize that the left and
right groups above are equivalent in both having three elements while
the middle group is different in that it has four elements. We end up
with an abstract notion of "three" or "three-ness." Whenever we see a
pile of objects we can decide whether or not it has this "three-ness"
property in the same way we can look at any object and decide whether
it has the property of "blue-ness."</p>

<p>
It turns out there is a mathematical language for quantifying symmetry
that is analogous to the way in which the language of the integers
quantifies amount. This language of symmetry will, for example, define
a property called "pgg symmetry." For any image, we will be able to
decide whether or not it has this property. Just as every pile of
objects can be labeled with "three-ness" or "five-ness" or "112-ness"
or ..., we'll be able to label any image with a particular type of
symmetry. For example, the left and middle images below have the same
amount of symmetry &mdash; namely, "p4g symmetry" &mdash; while the right
image has a different amount of symmetry, "pgg symmetry"</p>

<!--  These labels --- "p4g" -->
<!-- and "pgg" --- are analogous to the concepts of "three" or "threeness" -->
<!-- we use when talking about quantity. -->

<center>
<%= image_tag("p4g-v1-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
<%= image_tag("p4g-v2-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
<%= image_tag("pgg-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
</center>

<p>
As discussed in the next section, the approach that has been taken in
mathematics for quantifying symmetry is to focus on what geometric
transformations leave the original image/object unchanged. What is
perhaps surprising is that in some quite general situations, there are
only a finite number of collections of transformations we can end up
with. For example, for "wallpaper patterns" discussed below there are
exactly 17 possibilities: p4g, pgg and fifteen others. It's not obvious
from the outset that there are only a finite number of
possibilities. It's certainly not the case when talking about
quantity!</p>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Types of symmetry</summary>

<p>
Before getting to various types of symmetry such as "pgg symmetry," we
need to be a little more precise about what we mean by "symmetry."
We will then be able to introduce some atomic types of symmetries that
we can combine in a certain sense to yield these more advanced
concepts.</p>

<p>
For concreteness, let's assume we have image we're interested
in. A <i>symmetry</i> of the image is a "transformation" that leaves
it looking unchanged. The ones we will consider are
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_plane_isometry">Euclidean
plane isometries</a>. This will all become clearer in a moment as we
see some examples!</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<details>
  <summary>Rotational symmetry</summary>
  
<p>
One simple case is when the image/object can be rotated a certain
amount without changing its appearance. For example, if we rotate the
middle image below by 72 degrees (one fifth of a full rotation)
counterclockwise, the image is left unchanged. We say that "a rotation
of 72 degrees counterclockwise" is a <i>(rotational) symmetry</i> of
the middle image.</p>

<center>
<%= image_tag("rot2-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
<%= image_tag("rot5-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
<%= image_tag("rot18-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
</center>

<p>
Having a specific rotational symmetry generally provides additional
rotational symmetries as well. Take the middle image again. As
mentioned above, rotating it one fifth of a full revolution leaves it
unchanged. It follows that we can rotate it another one fifth and
still have an image that matches the original. But then we could have
rotated "twice 72 degrees," or 144 degrees, right from the start. In
fact, any multiple of 72 degrees works.</p>

<p>
Given a rotation R, we'll write R<sup>2</sup> for the rotation applied
twice, R<sup>3</sup> for the rotation applied three times,
etc. Continuing the example from above, if R is our 72-degree
counterclockwise rotation, then R<sup>2</sup> denotes 144 degrees
counterclockwise, R<sup>3</sup> denotes 216 degrees counterclockwise
and R<sup>4</sup> denotes 288 degrees counterclockwise. R<sup>5</sup>
&mdash; a rotation of 360 degrees &mdash; returns the image to its original
orientation.  We can continue with R<sup>6</sup>, R<sup>7</sup>,
etc. but these symmetries are redundant with ones we're mentioned.</p>
<p>
<b>Principle:</b> If a rotation <i>R</i> is a symmetry of an image, then so is <i>R<sup>n</sup></i>
for any positive integer <i>n</i>.
<p>
It's often convenient to identify the smallest rotation that is a
symmetry of an image. In the above three cases, these are rotations of
180, 72 and 20 degrees, respectively.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> To specify a rotation you must specify both an amount you
are rotating by as well as the point about which the rotation is being
made. In the above discussion it's implicit that each rotation is
about the center of the image. With some of the images we'll see later
on we will need to be more careful about this issue and will specify
the points of rotation explicitly.</p>

  <summary>The identity symmetry</summary>

<p>Now that we've seen rotations, it's a good time to mention that the
transformation that "does nothing" is also an isometry. If you'd like,
you can think of this as a rotation by zero degrees.</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>We won't need to concern ourselves with the identity
symmetry, but it becomes important when you delve into the mathematics
more rigorously. In such a case, it becomes useful to be able to
associate at least one symmetry to every image, even one such as the
below.</p>

<center>
  <%= image_tag("sunset.jpg", width: "25%") %>

<!-- Note that in the third picture there is some self-similarity, but it -->
<!-- requires rescaling --- a transformation we will not consider. -->

</details>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<details>
  <summary>Reflectional symmetry</summary>

<p>
We are all familiar with the bilateral symmetry of humans and many
animals. We can view this geometrically as an example of
a <i>reflectional symmetry</i>. With rotational symmetries there is an
implicit "center" of rotation. For reflections we need a <i>reflection
axis</i> (i.e., line) about which we are reflecting.</p>

<p>
The below three images have one, two, and four reflectional
symmetries, respectively.</p>

<center>
<%= image_tag("ref1-blue-crop.jpg", width: "20%") %>
<%= image_tag("ref2-blue-crop.jpg", width: "20%") %>
<%= image_tag("ref4-blue-crop.jpg", width: "20%") %>
</center>

<p>
Here are the same three images as above, but with the lines of
reflection marked explitly in orange.</p>

<center>
<%= image_tag("ref1-blue-crop-axis.jpg", width: "20%") %>
<%= image_tag("ref2-blue-crop-axis.jpg", width: "20%") %>
<%= image_tag("ref4-blue-crop-axis.jpg", width: "20%") %>
</center>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The second and third images above have both rotational and
reflectional symmetries (the middle image can be rotated 180 degrees;
the right image can be rotated 90 degrees). They are said to
have <i>dihedral</i> symmetry.</p>

</details>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
<details>
  <summary>Translational symmetry</summary>

<p>
A fourth type of symmetry arises from <i>translational
symmetries</i>. For example, in the below image, sliding everything
over to the right (or left) by certain amounts leaves the string of
images unchanged. Just as with rotations, if we let <i>T</i> denote a
given translation, then multiple applications of this translation
(e.g., T<sup>3</sup> for the translation applied three times) are also
symmetries. Note that for any of this to work, we need the images to
continue indefinitely to both the left and the right, but this is a
simply a matter of imagination. It's common to consider idealized
situations where patterns continue indefinitely.</p>

<center>
  <%= image_tag("eater-blue-crop.jpg", width: "25%") %>
</center>

<p>
In the above picture, all possible translations lie along a single
line: We can either translate to the right or to the left. Sometimes,
however, there are translations in two "independent" directions. This
is the case for the below image in which representative
translations are shown.</p>

<center>
  <%= image_tag("p1-blue-crop-axis.jpg", width: "25%") %>
</center>

<p>
<b>Convention:</b> We frequently have to imagine that the image continues
beyond what is shown for the symmetry to work.</p>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Glide symmetry</summary>

<p>
It will be convenient to consider one final class of symmetries known
as the <i>glide reflections</i>. A glide reflection can be thought of
as a translation followed by reflection (through the same axis we just
translated along). A representative glide reflection is shown below:
The orange arrow indicates the magnitude of the direction of the
translation and also serves as the line of reflection for the
subsequent reflection.</p>

<center>
  <%= image_tag("glide-crop.jpg", width: "50%") %>
</center>

<p>
Notice that if we denote a glide reflection by <i>G</i>,
then <i>G<sup>2</sup></i> is a translation since we have reflected
about the same axis twice.

</details>

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Grouping images by translations</summary>

We are now ready to make a preliminary, coarse division of images
according to how much translational symmetry they have.
<ul>
  <li> <details>
      <summary>2D discrete point groups: No translational symmetries</summary>  

      These are the symmetry groups that arise when there are no
      translations. The possibilities can be divided into two categories:
      <ul>
	<li> <b>Rotations only.</b> If a rotation of 360/n degrees can be
	  made, then the image is said to have <i>C<sub>n</sub> symmetry.</i>
	  (Here the "C" stands for "cyclic.") So we have the possibilities
	  C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>, etc. C<sub>1</sub>
	  indicates there are no rotations all that work other than going
	  around a complete 360 degrees.</li>
	<li> <b>Rotations and reflections.</b> If there is a reflectional
	  symmetry and a rotation of 360/n degrees is the smallest rotation
	  that can be made, then the image is said to have <i>D<sub>2n</sub>
	    symmetry.</i> (Here the "D" stands for "dihedral.") When n is at
	  least 3, D<sub>n</sub> embodies the symmetries associated a regular
	  n-gon. D<sub>1</sub> is the special case in which the only symmetry
	  is a single reflection. D<sub>2</sub> is the collection of
	  symmetries associated to a non-square rectangle.</li>
      </ul>    
      </details>
  </li>
  <li> <details>
      <summary>Frieze groups: "One-dimensional" symmetries</summary>

      <p>These are "one-dimensional" symmetries in which there is at
      least one translational symmetry, but for which all
      translational symmetries are paralllel. Images with symmetries
      encoded by a frieze group consist of a pattern repeated along an
      infinite line.</p>

      <p>
      Let's let <i>T</i> denote the shortest translation to
      the right that leaves the image unchanged. Any reflection is
      going to have to leave this translation line unchanged, so any
      reflection has to be about a vertical line or about a horizontal
      line coinciding with the translation axis. Similarly, any glide
      reflection will have to share an axis with the translation axis
      as well and any rotation will have to be of 180
      degrees. Naively, this leads to a categorization of 2*2*2*2=16
      possible collections of symmetry. It turns out that only 7
      combinations can be realized. We won't go through the proof
      here, but it boils down to the fact that there are relations
      among the different types of symmetry. For example, reflecting
      about a vertical axis and then above a horizontal axis results
      in a 180-degree rotation. So it's not possible to have an image
      with both vertical and horizontal reflections and no rotations.</p>

      <p>
      The reader might wonder about the possibilities for "where" any
      rotations or reflections about vertical axes appear. It turns
      out that because of the translational symmetry, if there is even
      one vertical reflection, thene there are an infinite number, one
      for each "unit cell."</p>

      <p>
	The 7 classes along with examples of each. For now I link to
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze_group#Descriptions_of_the_seven_frieze_groups">
	 wikipedia's table</a></p>

    </details>
  <li> <details>
      <summary>Wallpaper groups: "Two-dimensional symmetries"</summary>

      <p>
      These symmetries arise for images in which there are at least
      two translations that are not parallel. The name arises from the
      fact that many tradiational home wallpapers have patterns with
      such symmetries.</p>

      <p>
	It is a theorem that there are exactly 17 possibilities in
	this class. This is amazing! It's not obvious that there
	wouldn't be an infinite number of classes.</p>

      <p>
	The simplest, called <i>p1</i>, occurs when there are no
	symmetries other than the ones generated by the two
	independent translations. At the other end of the spectrum, an
	image with <i>p6m</i> symmetry is invariant under certain
	rotations by 60 degrees as well as under a number of
	reflections and glide transformations. Below we give examples
	of each type.</p>

      <p>
      The 17 classes with examples. For now I link to 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group#The_seventeen_groups">
	 wikipedia's table</a>. Eventually I would like to add something a little less complicated.</p>

      </details>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Note: </b> We are only considering images satisfying a
certain <i>discreteness condition</i>. Roughly, this means there
aren't "arbitrarily small" rotations or translations. Assuming this
condition means we don't have to consider an images such as a single
circle (arbitrary rotations), an infinite line (arbitrary
translations) or a uniform plane (arbitrary rotations and
translations).</p>
